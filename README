SUMMARY
-------

Spree is a complete open source commerce solution for Ruby on Rails.  It was originally developed by Sean Schofield
and is now maintained by a dedicated [core team](http://spreecommerce.com/core-team).  You can find out more about
by visiting the [Spree e-commerce project page](http://spreecommerce.com).


Dev Deployment 
-------------

Install your bundle

    bundle install

Then use the install generator to do the basic setup (add Spree to Gemfile, etc.)

    rails g spree:site

Now its time to install all of the necessary migrations, assets, etc.

    rake spree:install

If you'd like to also install sample data and images you can follow up the above command with:

    rake spree_sample:install

Now you just need to run the new migrations

    rake db:migrate
    rake db:seed

If you also want some sample products, orders, etc. to play with you can run the appropriate rake task.

    rake db:sample


Product Reviews
---------------

Next, run the rake task that copies the necessary migrations and assets to your project:

    rake spree_reviews:install

And finish with a migrate:

    rake db:migrate

Product Videos 
--------------
Install
    run `bundle install` on command or terminal
    run `rake spree_videos:install`
    run `rake db:migrate`
